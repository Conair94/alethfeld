    "solution": "Answer: The only such sequences are $a_{n}=n+C$, where $C$ is a nonnegative integer.\n\n## Common remarks.\n\n- Denote by $a_{[i, j]}$ the subsequence $a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_{j}$.\n- Without loss of generality, in each solution we suppose $p<q$. It can be convenient to treat the case where $p=1$ separately.\n- The problem can also be posed for sequences of arbitrary integers (rather than positive). Refer to the comment after Solution $1$ for a proof.\n\nSolution 1. Let $k=\\left\\lceil\\frac{q}{p}\\right\\rceil$. Note that $k \\geqslant 2$.\nLemma 1. If $i, j$ and $m$ are positive integers such that $|i-j| \\leqslant m p$ then $\\left|a_{i}-a_{j}\\right| \\leqslant m p$.\nProof. By the given condition, if $|i-j| \\leqslant p$ then $\\left|a_{i}-a_{j}\\right| \\leqslant p$. So the lemma follows from induction on $m$ and the triangle inequality.\nLemma 2. For a fixed $n$, suppose that $a_{i}$ is minimal over $i \\geqslant n$. Then $i \\leqslant n+p-1$.\nProof. Suppose for contradiction that $i \\geqslant n+p$. Then $\\min \\left(a_{[i-p, i+q-p]}\\right)=a_{i}$. Since $q-p \\leqslant$ $(k-1) p$, it follows from Lemma $1$ that $\\max \\left(a_{[i-p, i+q-p]}\\right) \\leqslant a_{i}+(k-1) p<a_{i}+q$, which is a contradiction.\n\nLemma 3. For a fixed $n>q$, suppose that $a_{i}$ is maximal over $i \\leqslant n$. Then $i \\geqslant n-p+1$.\nProof. Suppose $a_{j}$ is minimal over $j \\geqslant n-q$. Then by Lemma $2, j \\leqslant n-q+p-1$. So $\\min \\left(a_{[n-q, n]}\\right)=a_{j}$ and $a_{i} \\geqslant \\max \\left(a_{[n-q, n]}\\right)$, which implies that $a_{i} \\geqslant a_{j}+q$.\n\nLemma $2$ also implies that if $j \\geqslant n$ then $a_{j} \\geqslant \\min \\left(a_{[n, n+p]}\\right)$. So if $i<j$, then we have $a_{j} \\geqslant a_{i}-p$, which contradicts $a_{i} \\geqslant a_{j}+q$. Hence we must have $i>j$.\n\nThe above inequality also gives $\\left|a_{i}-a_{j}\\right| \\geqslant q>(k-1) p$, so by Lemma $1$ it follows that $|i-j|>(k-1) p$. Therefore $i>j+(k-1) p \\geqslant n-q+(k-1) p \\geqslant n-p+1$.\n\nLet $b_{n}$ be the minimal value of $a_{i}$ for $i \\geqslant n$. By Lemma $2, b_{n+p}>b_{n}$ for all $n$. Hence $b_{n}=\\min \\left(a_{[n, n+p]}\\right)=\\min \\left(a_{[n, n+q]}\\right)$. Let $c_{n}$ be the maximal value of $a_{i}$ for $i \\leqslant n$. By Lemma 3, $c_{n-p}>c_{n}$ for all $n>q$. Hence $c_{n}=\\max \\left(a_{[n-p, n]}\\right)=\\max \\left(a_{[n-q, n]}\\right)$ for $n>q$.\n\nSo if $n>q$ then $b_{n}=c_{n+p}-p=c_{n+q}-q$. So for $n>q$ we get $b_{n+q-p}+p=c_{n+q}=b_{n}+q$, and hence $b_{n+q-p}=b_{n}+q-p$.\n\nNext note that $b_{n+p} \\leqslant a_{n+p} \\leqslant b_{n}+p$. So $b_{n+p}-b_{n} \\leqslant p$ for all $n>q$, and iterating this $(q-p)$ times gives $b_{n+p(q-p)}-b_{n} \\leqslant p(q-p)$. But using $b_{n+q-p}=b_{n}+q-p$ gives $b_{n+p(q-p)}-b_{n}=p(q-p)$. Since equality occurs, we must have $b_{n+p}=b_{n}+p$.\n\nSo for $n>q, b_{n+p}=b_{n}+p$ and $b_{n+q-p}=b_{n}+q-p$. Since $p$ and $q-p$ are coprime, $b_{n+1}=b_{n}+1$ for all $n>q$. The only way for $b_{n}$ and $b_{n+1}$ to be different is if $b_{n}=a_{n}$, so we deduce that $a_{n+1}=a_{n}+1$ and there is a constant $C$ such that $a_{n}=n+C$ for all $n>q$.\n\nFinally, suppose $a_{n}=n+C$ for all $n \\geqslant N$. Then $p=\\max \\left(a_{N-1}, N+C+p-1\\right)-$ $\\min \\left(a_{N-1}, N+C\\right)$. So $a_{N-1}=N+C+p$ or $N+C-1$. Similarly, $a_{N-1}=N+C+q$ or $N+C-1$. Hence $a_{N-1}=N+C-1$. So, by induction, we have $a_{n}=n+C$ for all positive integers $n$. Since $a_{1} \\geqslant 1, C$ is a nonnegative integer.\n\nIt is trivial to check that $a_{n}=n+C$ satisfies the given condition.\n\nComment. Here is a variant of Solution 1. Proceed up to proving $b_{n}-n$ is eventifally periodic with period $q-p$. Then there is some minimal value of $b_{n}-n$. Suppose $n$ attains this minimal value, Since $b_{n+p}-n-p \\leqslant b_{n}-n, n+p$ also attains this minimal value. And since $p$ and $y-p$ are coprime, all $n \\geqslant q$ must attain this minimal value. Hence $b_{n+1}=b_{n}+1$ for all $n \\geqslant q$. Finish as above,\n\nComment. It is also possible to solve the problem using a weaker version of Lemma $2$ and withont Lemma 3. For example, the following lemma plays a similar role.\nLemma 2'. Let $b_{n}^{\\prime}=\\min \\left(a_{[n, n+p]}\\right)$. Then $b_{n}^{\\prime}<b_{n+p}^{\\prime}$.\nComment. To solve the problem for sequences $a_{n}$ of arbitrary integers, we will use the following lemma.\nLemma 4. The sequence $a_{n}$ is either bounded above or bounded below.\nProof. Suppose that $a_{n}$ is unbounded above and below. Then there is some $i$ such that $a_{i}<a_{1}-p$. There is also some $j$ such that $a_{j}>\\max \\left(a_{[1, i]}\\right)+q$. Now let $a_{l}$ be minimal amongst $a_{[1, j]}$. Since $a_{l} \\leqslant a_{i}, a_{l}<a_{1}-p$ and $a_{l}<a_{j}-k p$. By Lemma $1,1+p<l<j-k p$. So min $\\left(a_{[l-p, l+q-p]}\\right)=a_{l}$. By Lemma $1$ again, $\\max \\left(a_{[l-p, l+q-p]}\\right) \\leqslant a_{l}+(k-1) p<a_{l}+q$, which is a contradiction.\n\nFrom there, the solution above can be adapted to prove that $a_{n}=n+C$ for all $n$ or $a_{n}=-n+C$ for all $n$, where $C$ can be any constant integer.",

    "solution": "Solution 1. We will show that the eventual period of sequence $\\left(b_{n}\\right)$ consists of any fixed number of occurrences of $G$ (possibly zero) followed by a single $A$.\n\nWe look at the ratios of consecutive terms of the sequence $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$. Let $C$ and $D$ be coprime positive integers such that $a_{1} / a_{0}=(C+D) / C$. If $b_{n}=G$ then $a_{n} / a_{n-1}=a_{n+1} / a_{n}$. If $b_{n}=A$ and $a_{n} / a_{n-1}=(C+k D) /(C+(k-1) D)$ for some positive integer $k$ then\n\n$$\n\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}=\\frac{2 a_{n}-a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}=\\frac{C+(k+1) D}{C+k D} .\n$$\n\nThus, by induction, there is a sequence of positive integers $\\left(k_{n}\\right)$ for $n \\geqslant 1$ which satisfies $a_{n} / a_{n-1}=\\left(C+k_{n} D\\right) /\\left(C+\\left(k_{n}-1\\right) D\\right)$ for all positive integers $n$. Moreover, we have $k_{1}=1$ and\n\n$$\nk_{n+1}= \\begin{cases}k_{n}, & \\text { if } b_{n}=G \\\\ k_{n}+1, & \\text { if } b_{n}=A\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIf there are only finitely many values of $n$ such that $b_{n}=A$ then the problem statement obviously holds (we can choose $d=1$ ). Thus, we may assume that $b_{n}=A$ for infinitely many $n$. This means that the sequence ( $k_{n}$ ) attains all positive integer values. Given a value $q \\geqslant 1$, denote by $m_{q}$ the last index where value $q$ occurs, that is, the index such that $k_{m_{q}}=q$ and $k_{m_{q}+1}=q+1$.\n\nOur aim is to prove that the sequence of differences $\\left(m_{q+1}-m_{q}\\right)$ is eventually constant. We first show that it is bounded above. To that end, fix $t \\geqslant 1$ (we will choose a suitably large $t$ later on) and consider a sequence $s(t)_{0}, s(t)_{1}, \\ldots$ defined for $q \\geqslant 1$ by $s(t)_{q}=a_{m_{q}} /(C+q D)^{t}$.\n\nWe note two properties of $s(t)_{q}$. First, simple algebra gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns(t)_{q+1}= & \\frac{a_{m_{q+1}}}{(C+(q+1) D)^{t}}=\\frac{a_{m_{q}}}{(C+(q+1) D)^{t}}\\left(\\frac{C+(q+1) D}{C+q D}\\right)^{m_{q+1}-m_{q}} \\\\\n& =\\frac{a_{m_{q}}}{(C+q D)^{t}}\\left(\\frac{C+(q+1) D}{C+q D}\\right)^{m_{q+1}-m_{q}-t}=s(t)_{q}\\left(\\frac{C+(q+1) D}{C+q D}\\right)^{m_{q+1}-m_{q}-t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\n\\left.\\begin{array}{l}\ns(t)_{q}>s(t)_{q+1} \\\\\ns(t)_{q}=s(t)_{q+1} \\\\\ns(t)_{q}<s(t)_{q+1}\n\\end{array}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { if and only if } \\quad\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nm_{q+1}-m_{q}<t \\\\\nm_{q+1}-m_{q}=t \\\\\nm_{q+1}-m_{q}>t\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nSecond, suppose that $m_{q+1}-m_{q} \\geqslant t$ for some positive integer $q$. We claim that in that case $s(t)_{q}$ is a positive integer. Indeed, we have\n\n$$\na_{m_{q}+t}=a_{m_{q}}\\left(\\frac{C+(q+1) D}{C+q D}\\right)^{t}\n$$\nbecause $k_{m_{q}+1}=k_{m_{q}+2}=\\cdots=k_{m_{q}+t}=q+1$. Since $C+(q+1) D$ and $C+q D$ are coprime we have that\n$$\ns(t)_{q}=\\frac{a_{m_{q}}}{(C+q D)^{t}}\n$$\n\nis an integer.\nWe choose $T \\geqslant 1$ such that $s(T)_{1}<1$ (which exists since $C+D>1$ ). Then, by induction we can show that $s(T)_{q}<1$ for all $q$. Indeed, since $s(T)_{q}<1$, it is not a positive integer; this means that $m_{q+1}-m_{q}<T$ by the second property above. Hence by the first property above we have $s(T)_{q+1}<s(T)_{q}<1$, as needed.\n\nThis means that $m_{q+1}-m_{q}<T$ for all $q$. Thus there is a largest integer $T^{\\prime} \\leqslant T$ with the property that an equality $m_{q+1}-m_{q}=T^{\\prime}$ holds for infinitely many values of $q$.\n\nTherefore, for all sufficiently large values of $q$ we have the inequality $m_{q+1}-m_{q} \\leqslant T^{\\prime}$, which by the first property implies that the sequence $s\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)$ is decreasing from some point on. Moreover, we know that the sequence attains infinitely many integer values since there are infinitely many values of $q$ for which we have the equality $m_{q+1}-m_{q}=T^{\\prime}$. As a consequence, the sequence $s\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)$ is constant from some sufficiently large index $Q$ onwards.\n\nThis in turn means that the equality $m_{q+1}-m_{q}=T^{\\prime}$ holds for all $q \\geqslant Q$. Note that $b_{n}=A$ is equivalent to the fact that $n=m_{q}$ for some integer $q$. Thus, the sequence $\\left(b_{n}\\right)$ is periodic for $n \\geqslant Q$ with period $T^{\\prime}$, and the proof is complete.",
