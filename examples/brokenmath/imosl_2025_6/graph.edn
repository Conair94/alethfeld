   "KEY INSIGHT: Once the ratio becomes non-integer (by applying A), it stays non-integer forever. Proof: $T_A(r) = 2 - 1/r$. If $r = p/q$ with $\\gcd(p,q)=1$ and $q > 1$, then $T_A(r) = (2pq - q)/(pq) = (2p-1)/p \\cdot q/(q) = (2p-1)q/(pq)$... wait, let me redo: $T_A(p/q) = 2 - q/p = (2p-q)/p$. For this to be in lowest terms, we need $\\gcd(2p-q, p) = \\gcd(-q, p) = \\gcd(q,p) = 1$. So $T_A(p/q) = (2p-q)/p$ is already in lowest terms. Thus if $q > 1$, the denominator becomes $p > 1$ (since $p > q$ for $r > 1$).",
